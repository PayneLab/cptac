    "\n",
    "The National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is a national effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteome and genome analysis, or proteogenomics. CPTAC generates comprehensive proteomics and genomics data from clinical cohorts, typically with ~100 samples per tumor type. The graphic below summarizes the structure of each CPTAC dataset. For more information, visit the [NIH website](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac). \n",

This first tutorial serves as an introduction to the data to help users become familiar with what is included and how it is presented."

    "The goals of CPTAC as a consortium include the broad and open dissemination of cancer proteogenomic data. The timing of a dataset's public release generally follows three stages: internal release to CPTAC investigators, public release with a publication embargo, and full public release.

    "In addition to donating a tumor sample, some patients also had a normal sample taken for control and comparison. We can identify these samples by looking for samples marked \"Normal\" in the \"Sample_Tumor_Normal\" column, and whose Patient IDs are the same as the Patient IDs of tumor samples, but with a \".N\" appended to the ID. For example, patient C3L-00006 provided both a tumor sample (marked C3L-00006) and a normal sample (marked C3L-00006.N). Note that the normal samples do not have many values in the clinical columns, because much of the information does not apply to non-tumor samples. Additionally, in cases where a column would have identical values for tumor and normal samples from the same patient (e.g., patient age and gender), the information is recorded only for the tumor sample."
